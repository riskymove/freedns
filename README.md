## Rules Broken from what I could find (only relevant to HCPS students)
### will directly break:
- no rules

### possible misconceptions:
- this is not a virtual private network (VPN)
- this will not break this rule related to bypassing network restrictions, "The HCPS community will not bypass the network restrictions by using an external network"
- this is not installing any software without authorization as you are not installing this app, you are running a portable (non-install) version

### possible to break:
- accessing chat rooms/messaging apps
- doxing anyone (photo, address, etc)
- receiving/sending nsfw content
- violating any actual law
- accessing inappropriate material (not defined in document)
- using your personal email
