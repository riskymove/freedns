### Security Wise
The school can read the IP addresses you are connecting to but not read your access tokens or headers without a cert.<br>
basically:<br>
if you go to `https://google.com/search?q=test`<br>
the school can see you went to `142.251.40.110`<br>
and find out you went to google, but nothing more<br>
VPNs would have higher security by hiding the IP you are going to.

### Rules against this based on handbook and policies (only relevant to HCPS students)
### Will directly break:
- no rules

### Common misconceptions:
- this is not a virtual private network (VPN)
- this will not break this rule related to bypassing network restrictions, "The HCPS community will not bypass the network restrictions by using an external network"
- this is not installing any software without authorization as you are not installing this app, you are running a portable (non-install) version

### Possible to break:
- accessing chat rooms/messaging apps
- doxing anyone (photo, address, etc)
- receiving/sending nsfw content
- violating any actual law
- accessing inappropriate material (not defined in document)
- using your personal email
